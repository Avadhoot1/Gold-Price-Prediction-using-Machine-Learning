# Gold-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project uses Python and machine learning to predict gold prices based on historical data. The goal is to build a predictive model that can help investors and analysts understand the factors influencing gold prices and forecast future trends.


📊 Features

✅ Predict gold prices using historical data

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key trends and correlations

✅ Feature engineering & data preprocessing

✅ Model training & evaluation


📁 Dataset

Dataset: gold_data.csv

Contains historical gold price data and related features.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python

Libraries Used:

numpy — numerical computations

pandas — data manipulation

seaborn & matplotlib — data visualization

scikit-learn — machine learning algorithms & tools

random forest — prediction model

🤖 Why Random Forest?

The Random Forest algorithm was chosen because:

It is robust to overfitting and performs well on tabular data.

It can handle non-linear relationships between features and the target.

It provides feature importance scores, helping to understand which factors most influence gold prices.

It works well with both small and large datasets, and can capture complex interactions in the data.
